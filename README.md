# Obsidian Kobo Highlight Importer

This plugin aims to make highlight import from Kobo devices easier.

## How to use

Once installed, the steps to import your highlights directly into the vault are:

1. Connect your Kobo device to PC using a proper USB cable
2. Check if it has mounted automatically, or mount it manually (e.g. open the root folder of your Kobo using a file manager)
3. Open the import window using the plugin button
4. Locate _KoboReader.sqlite_ in the _.kobo_ folder ( this folder is hidden, so if you don't see it you should enable hidden files view from system configs )
5. Extract

## Supported Devices

The following devices have been confirmed to work with this plugin:

- Kobo Aura H2O

If your device is not in this list, there could be a chance that it's not supported.
Please open an issue to add support.

To be able to add support, the database that the device produces must be shared.
As this is the key factor that determines support.
Each device seems to produce a different layout of the database.

The database can contain sensitive information.
For this reason, please **DO NOT** share your database via a Github issue.
Rather, reach out via [Discord](https://obsidian.md/community) so that the exchange can be done via DM.
